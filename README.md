| [Observer 观察者模式](/behavioral/observer.md) | Provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data | ✔ |
| [Registry 注册模式](/behavioral/registry.md) | Keep track of all subclasses of a given class | ✘ |
| [State 状态模式](/behavioral/state.md) | Encapsulates varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state | ✘ |
| [Strategy 策略模式](/behavioral/strategy.md) | Enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime | ✔ |
| [Template 模版模式](/behavioral/template.md) | Defines a skeleton class which defers some methods to subclasses | ✘ |

## Synchronization Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Status |

| [Lock/Mutex 互斥锁模式](/synchronization/mutex.md) | Enforces mutual exclusion limit on a resource to gain exclusive access | ✘ |
| [Monitor 监听者模式](/synchronization/monitor.md) | Combination of mutex and condition variable patterns | ✘ |
| [Read-Write Lock 读写锁模式](/synchronization/read_write_lock.md) | Allows parallel read access, but only exclusive access on write operations to a resource | ✘ |

| [Generators 生成器模式](/concurrency/generator.md) | Yields a sequence of values one at a time | ✔ |
| [Reactor 反应器模式](/concurrency/reactor.md) | Demultiplexes service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler and dispatches them syncronously to the associated request handlers | ✘ |
| [Parallelism 并行模式](/concurrency/parallelism.md) | Completes large number of independent tasks | ✔ |

| [Fan-Out 流水线模式](/messaging/fan_out.md) | Distributes tasks among workers (e.g. producer) | ✔ |
| [Futures & Promises](/messaging/futures_promises.md) | Acts as a place-holder of a result that is initially unknown for synchronization purposes | ✘ |
| [Publish/Subscribe](/messaging/publish_subscribe.md) | Passes information to a collection of recipients who subscribed to a topic | ✔ |
